            Amid the pandemic that affected the entire world, Melbourne had the
            Izabella Rios was looking for ways to maintain her mental health
            amid the chaos the world was experiencing. Passionate about
            cosmetics, Izabella dedicated years working in a large cosmetics
            industry in Brazil and then decided to deepen her knowledge in
            cosmetic formulations.
          </p>
          <p class="fw-light text-start p-2">
            She finished her course in cosmetic formulation and began acquiring
            ingredients and equipment to test her knowledge. With simple
            equipment and the desire to create personal care products, the first
            formulations generated more confidence and the desire to create more
            and more. Care for the environment meant that the formulations were
            simple and with vegan ingredients.
          </p>

            The world was returning to normal, it was time to see friends and
            loved ones and with that came feedback from friends who used them
            and increasingly asked for the products to go on the market. It was
            during this period that Izabella saw an opportunity to present to
            the world a brand that thinks about skin care and the environment in
            which we live.Thus, Bella Cosmetics was born. A cosmetics brand that
            is concerned about the environment, with 100% vegan formulas and no
            animal testing. An independent brand created with great care and
            quality for a moment of you with you.
